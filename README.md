## Introduction
In the digital age, healthcare is undergoing a monumental transformation driven by advanced technologies. My project leverages the power of Kubernetes to significantly improve access to and quality of healthcare for populations. By using cutting-edge medical devices to collect clinical data, this innovative system enables the accurate and continuous recording of vital signs and other essential health information.

Connected medical devices gather crucial real-time health data, that are securely transmitted to the Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes, known for its ability to orchestrate containers in a scalable and efficient manner, receives, processes, and stores the data, ensuring their integrity and continuous availability. Once processed, the data are presented through intuitive interfaces accessible to healthcare professionals, allowing for continuous and detailed monitoring of patients' health status. This system not only enhances the speed and accuracy of medical care but also enables predictive analysis, identifying potential risks and optimizing therapeutic responses.

In this project, two primary services are implemented: one concerning the recording of heart rate and another related to cerebral electrical activity.
